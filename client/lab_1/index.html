    <h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to<em> draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to<strong> strongly emphasize something</strong>  in the text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h2> Empty Elements</h2>

        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

    <h2> Images </h2>

        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
        <img src='images/onigiri_1.png' alt='Forward facing'/>
        <img src='images/onigiri_2.png' alt='Forward facing 2'/>
